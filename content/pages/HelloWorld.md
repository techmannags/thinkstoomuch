# Welcome to my Site!

This is my newblogging site... I guess. 

I've been wanting to find a place to collect and share my ideas for years now. Hopefully this becomes a regular habit that I can maintain for years, but we need to start small by starting the site and introducing what I do.

## Things to see

I am an avid enjoyer of what I believe to be a stereotypical collection of hobbies: Hiking, History, Philosophy, Politics, Art, and Computers! 

## Background

I have 4 years of college behind me in both computer science and history. I have worked state government and private sector IT along with years of a slew of fun jobs before I settled back on my first love of computers.
